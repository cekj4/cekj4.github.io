		<p> Dear Hiring Manager,

			I am writing to express my interest in a Software Tester position in your company. With a strong foundation in Software Development, I have developed key technical skills and a deep understanding of testing principles that would allow me to contribute effectively in this role.
			
			During my studies at the National College of Ireland, I gained hands-on experience with programming languages such as Java, .NET development, web design and client-side scripting, object oriented software engineering and databases. My exposure to both front-end and back-end development has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of how software systems work, making me well-equipped to identify potential issues during the testing process. Additionally, my training in project management methodologies like Agile and Waterfall, as well as my Scrum Master certification, allows me to collaborate efficiently with development teams and ensure a smooth workflow during the software testing cycle.
			
			I am highly motivated to bring my knowledge and skills into the software testing field, ensuring the quality and reliability of applications. I am confident that my background in software development and understanding of frameworks and processes will enable me to thrive as a Software Tester in your company.
			
			Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience align with the needs of your team.
			
			Sincerely,
			Jacek Pawula</p>
